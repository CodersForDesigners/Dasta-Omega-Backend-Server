# Issues
## Updating a Prospect
If the `Budget` field is part of the changeset, the update will fail. Somehow, the `Budget` field on Zoho has become (or was always) a "Lookup" field and not a "Picklist" field it is supposed to be.

## Uploading / Attaching Quotes
Currently, it simply references the resource, not uploads it.
This is the case in the "Attach Resource" and "Quote Create" routes.
